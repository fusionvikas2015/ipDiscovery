# ipDiscovery v1.0

This is an open source python library solves the above critical problem of retrieving OS-assigned IP addresses during 
automated deployment workflows—without relying on manual steps or external agents like HPE AMS, etc.

## Key Benefits of the `ipDiscovery` Library

- **Solves a Critical Deployment Problem**  
  Automatically retrieves OS-assigned IP addresses during deployment workflows, eliminating the need for manual steps.


- **No Dependency on External Agents**  
  Works without requiring external agents like **HPE AMS** — truly agentless.


- **Uses DHCP Lease Data for IP Mapping**  
  Securely determines assigned IPs by leveraging MAC-to-IP mapping from DHCP lease data.


- **Streamlines Post-Deployment Automation**  
  Eliminates a key bottleneck in OS validation pipelines, allowing automation to proceed smoothly.


- **Enhances Scalability and Reliability**  
  Supports scalable, reliable test environments with minimal human intervention.


- **Secure and Easy Integration**  
  Features secure data handling and is easy to integrate into CI/CD or automation workflows.


- **Transforms Manual to Automated Workflows**  
  Converts traditionally manual processes into fully automated, high-performance solutions.
